This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to StartSOLE (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use StartSOLE on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">The technologies and information we automatically collect include:</span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_86ayom21ah02-0 start"><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Cookies and other similar technologies: We (or our service providers) may use cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in Student or Outside Accounts logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Service that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don&#39;t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our Service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with Brasstacks LLC and the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c9" target="_blank" href="https://www.strengthenu.org/">StrengthenU</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">application). </span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Local storage: We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage (including HTTP cookies and HTML5) and application data caches.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">Like many services, StartSOLE (or our service providers) uses both local storage and cookies and other similar technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand your engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you -&ndash;for example, by remembering your language preferences or other information so that you will not have to re-enter it during the next time you visit the Services.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">Device information: We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version and settings, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers (including unique device IDs). We may also collect device event information such as crashes, system activity, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve StartSOLE for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you&#39;ve opted in to receive them.</span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_bspml7gb58wv-0 start"><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Mobile application information: Certain mobile applications or &quot;apps&quot; include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to StartSOLE when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install a StartSOLE-developed App, when you open the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve a StartSOLE-developed App.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Server log information: Like most online services, when you use our Service we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. Examples include things like:</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_bspml7gb58wv-1 start"><li class="c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Telephone log information like your phone number and SMS routing information</span></li><li class="c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">IP address</span></li><li class="c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Details of how you used our Service, such as your activity on the Service (including product event data used to track progress or user activity), and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Service (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show)</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_bspml7gb58wv-0"><li class="c12 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next -&ndash; for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular and to send notifications to a device (such as push notifications if the user opted in) to encourage the user to finish an activity or start the next activity. We may use your IP address and share it with third parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Service, to enhance the Services based on usage pattern data and for analytics and for advertising. </span></li><li class="c5 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Location information: When you use our Service, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example, based on your IP address. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we request precise geolocation information (&quot;precise&quot; meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher or parent is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We &nbsp;never request precise geolocation data from students or Outside Accounts. From all users, if they upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use StartSOLE&#39;s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file -&ndash;e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the person receiving a message). If a user accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device&#39;s own camera roll).</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">We will not store or track your precise device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geolocation data with third-parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your precise location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.</span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_8m7lhzpxa7im-0 start"><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Cross-device collection: To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c1">Product events: As users interact with the product, we collect product events about how the product is being used (e.g., the number of points given, which reports are viewed, which features are used, which buttons are clicked, load time, etc.). These are collected to provide the Services, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality. We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending push or email notifications to the parent&#39;s, teacher&#39;s, or student&#39;s device to encourage them to take certain actions in the StartSOLE Service. Our product event logs may also include unique device IDs and IP addresses. We automatically delete IP addresses tracked in product logs after six months.</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">Information Received from Third Party Sources</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us (e.g. survey information or information about the name of teachers and address of schools). If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties&quot;. Local law may require you to authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. We do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.
